Database Administration Project README
Overview
This project focuses on database administration tasks, specifically the cleaning and filtering of a dataset, followed by the creation of a relational database using SQLDeveloper. The primary goal is to demonstrate proficiency in handling data, ensuring data quality, and designing a well-structured relational database.

Project Components

  1. Dataset Cleaning
  Before creating the database, the dataset undergoes cleaning to ensure data quality and integrity. This involves tasks such as:
    Handling missing or null values.
    Standardizing data formats.
    Removing duplicates.
    Addressing inconsistencies in data.

  3. Database Schema Design
  A well-structured relational database schema is crucial for efficient data management. The design process includes:
    Identifying entities and their relationships.
    Normalizing the database schema.
    Defining primary and foreign keys.
    Ensuring data integrity through constraints.

  3. SQLDeveloper Implementation
  The cleaned dataset is then used to create a relational database using Oracle SQLDeveloper. Key steps include:
    Creating the necessary tables based on the designed schema.
    Defining indexes for performance optimization.
    Implementing constraints to maintain data integrity.
    Loading cleaned data into the respective tables.

Now the front line has clearly been drawn between civilization and savagery.

You just have to fish a cable through the corner.  I do this by unzipping the side compartment enough to fish through the cable.  It makes it so I can leave a pass through USB travel battery charger with folding prongs, that means I plug in all my devices when they''re in the zip area (laptop, phone, tablet and airpods) and they all get charge from the battery AND when I get to the hotel late, I just plug one one cable into the wall outlet and I hear all my devices chime in unison that they are now charging neatly in place.

I remember thinking during the Genesis/Turbografx era (SNES not out quite yet) what games would be like when I was old, and the kind of specs they would need.  Obviously I had no idea what the specs really meant back then, but I was thinking "256-bit" lol.  (as for the CPU, and 64-bit is all we really need for that)  They have happily progressed faster than I had imagined, looking just as good today, if not better, then I imagined things would look like 20~25 years from now.  The 1990''s and early 2000''s with the massive clock speed increases and the advent of the GPU were the main things that took us to where we are, hardware wise.',28);

I’d like to see it not as a competition but rather a companion to renewables in the future electrical generation portfolio. On the downside, nuclear is expensive to build and insure, but the actual watts  generated are among the cheapest. There are also concerns about the total available uranium to run the reactors, and it seems like we’ll have enough of it for 50-100 years if we generate 40-50% of the energy from nuclear. On top of that, thorium reactors could be a viable alternative to their uranium counterparts. Another new direction in nuclear is small modular reactors (4th gen) which in theory should be much cheaper to build and run, making initial investment lower. They would also give us greater agility in planning the electrical grid.',42);

If you have been closely watching the crypto <or even invested in it, chances are that you are wondering whether the latest bear cycle is over. The truth is that the market remains unpredictable especially in the long-term. Despite the heavy outflows, Bitcoin still managed to promptly recover, this recovery demonstrated Bitcoin’s strength despite being stress tested against highly volatile and unfavorable market conditions. Could this outcome be a sign that the market is ready for a bigger recovery? The obvious answers is yes despite how long it might take, it is very important to stay ahead of the market by trading with the right strategy. I have been trading with Boston Weber’s signals and strategy for 3 weeks which I have been able to accumulate 10.8 btc with his signals. He’s a trader i believe everyone else can also work it..',83);

And benefits they were unaware with before turn out to be far more beneficial.  Few if any rug pulls.

The good thing about the space is that you can buy the dips and put them into active trades making profits from trades while confidently waiting for a pump in price because it is inevitable. Most people do not understand how the space works. Your advantage is understanding, Charts won’t guarantee what an asset is going to do. Prices will go up or down.

So clear and user friendly.  I am an older person who has cubed for 15 years. I solve many cubes, cuboids, odd shaped magic cubes, and supercubes and these often require the basic moves you teach here.  So while this is very beginner it is also very useful for advanced complex cubes that can''t be solved with advanced algs,  A pleasure!!

Fishers mental health was probably not caused by chess but the pressure that came to surround him due to his success at chess.

The only company that can use iOS is also Apple, so there''s not 5 different companies doing their own thing and its up to you to figure out which Android device is best. Additionally, Apple may be "late to the party" with certain things, but when they finally come out with a new product or feature you know it''s going to work significantly better than the competition. Apple may be more costly, but I''d rather pay more and have a good experience than to have a phone that is unreliable and save money that would probably get wasted on something anyway.',32);

There are lots of unresolved bug fixes besides mine. If a low percent of customers have a specific problem, they won’t put time into fixing.

When i was around 7/8 i usually went fishing with my family and when they were preparing the motor etc., me and older brother (and in that day my cousins) were playing with the underwater firearm (more a aquatic arch, don''t know the exact english name, not very dangerous and my brother was the only one who could manage it) seeing if we could catch some fish that lay around the boats, when we across a really big head fish coming to surface and diving (really big and to this day never saw something like that, especially in the docs). The most scary part it was, when we were chasing the fish (so my brother could shoot), we saw a really big big fish tail from the same fish doing a S in the surface. It was so scary that we frooze scared and start calling desperatly for help. It could be a eel but it was to damn big and large to be one. From that day on i''m scared to go fishing. Not kidding. This happend in Portugal (sorry if my english is wrong, not my native language)',90);

The “study like it’s your last test” even though you’re taking it twice is an interesting approach. I get the value in it but I actually say the opposite to my students because they get so stressed out. I tell them not to worry and just relax in there because they can always take it again!

We are only told via Otto''s report, and we know they despised each other. The labeling could be interpreted in either good or bad way. Just like the title "The Queen Who Never Was" could be considered a mockery but also it could mean you acknowledge that she should be the queen. Maybe Daemon is indeed honoring his dead nephew. One thing is for sure though, i think his love for his brother is genuine, however rogue his ways are. He knows his brother is weak and he sees Otto Hightower for what he is, he really wanted to protect his brother from crows that''s waiting for a feast.

When the science fair day came, my booth wasn''t the most popular with any of the other kids, but with all the school teachers and parents... they loved it. I remember the results of my project was inconclusive because I tested each student individually with each individual method of learning.

Over the years it gradually dawned on me that the many educational theories, which were forced on us were based on absolutely nothing but unproven theory. Learning style was just one of many. Nearly every year a new style or theory would be introduced. Nobody ever rigorously challenged these theories (presented as facts) demanding evidence and proof. Ever. Yet if you did not adapt your teaching to incorporate these unproven styles you would be judged to be a failing teacher. So you had no choice. At least whilst being observed!! I became quite cynical in the end because I realised the new methods were invented and then promoted by people just trying to further their career with something for their CV. And each method would last a year or two before going out of fashion and being replaced by a new one.

I think the part about scores being inflated because schools don''t have to report bad test scores since students aren''t submitting bad tests scores makes sense. However, I do tell my students that submitting scores is beneficial to them if they can because the U.S. World News Report requires a school to report at least 50% of its students'' scores in order for them to remain competitive in the rankings.

In highscool I was a 2.0 gpa student. Barely putting the effort to muster a C. My only way getting into college was soccer but eventually I quit due to mental health. I was really depressed and didn’t have any motivation for anything. Had no friends no job and overall I was in a bad state in hs. I just turned 20 now back in community college trying to get a degree eventually gonna transfer. But yeah would’ve wished i had better guidance and wished I could go back and change that so I wouldn’t have made it harder on myself. I didn’t even go to prom no football game nothing and overall had no social life. Starting to change now How I am now and it’s honestly making me a better person and happier.

Now, the problem is, I''m being praised. Why? I am great at finding the one answer. I can take tests very well, but am typically not the best at projects. Math is my best subject, English is my worst, where you typically have to write creative essays. I want to be an engineer, so at my school, we have an elective called pre-engineering. It''s one of the closest classes to an actual job that''s available at my school. And I''m not the best at it. Sure I can do the math required, but coming up with ideas for better designs is hard. I feel that this shows that my education is doing the opposite of preparing me for the future. It''s telling me that there''s one answer, which is never the case in engineering. I hope that soon enough we can have an education overhaul, and realize that we need to change education.',345);

There is no difference between high school and community colleges. There is also no guarantee you will find work with a degree. Just because you have a degree doesn''t mean your work is good. Professors will rarely tell you if your portfolio is good because they don''t care. The institution they work for already have their money.

But the modern students who I teach (there are 500 on my university of York dissertation module), are faced and burdened with limitless access to knowledge, and the fields of literature become endless. The student has to navigate a constant tension between chaos and order. I find examples help, so students can see the limits and horizons before them.

It looked fine and it was paved and everything, and it was significantly shorter than the alternative route. Only our plans were thwarted, because shortly after turning onto that road we came to a tractor, and it was moving really really slowly in front of us. We couldn’t turn around either because the road was too narrow and there was a metal fence on one side and a steep hill on the other. We literally just had to slowly drive behind this tractor for almost the entire length of the road, and it took about an hour.',2016);

For example, before I go on a long drive to a destination I have never been to before, I always check the routes on Google Maps by zooming in for both satellite view and map view. Then figure out if those routes are safe to take or better to take a longer one. It''s unfortunate these two groups of people went through what they did. So it''s a lesson for everyone to be mindful before setting out to unknown territory.

They viewed these stories through a lens of exotification, without realising that it''s ALL real and that it''s a description of the absurdities found in Latin American societies. If we think about what exotification is, it''s about seeing what''s mundane or normalized in one society and treating it as special or unique because one is not used to it. It''s very much about ignorance and how what we don''t understand can often appear magical. As a result, how these authors chose to tell the story is what mattered.

I completely agree with your explanation of magic realism and also the idea that it is a post colonial resistance against Eurocentrism, but I think its scope is even bigger. One aspect of magic realism is politically ideological, that is the postcolonial stuff. Another aspect is challenging the constricted mentality created by strict adherence to materialistic/scientific determinism. This aspect is more philosophical, and not just ethical like the ideological aspect but also epistemological or maybe even metaphysical i.e. it may draw our attention to fundamental questions about the nature of reality and the likes. This is just my personal opinion.',26);

Which almost put me off but out of pride I couldn’t give up. Only to become fascinated by how all these buildings that were built for people, are no longer there. So who do these objects serve? This book was written in 2017 with an international look as  these creators (to encapsulate both artists and architects). In a series of interviews have to explain their method. Some are coy but those willing to share open up this view of how they see the world in relation to the notion of space.

I often feel the urge to reject feminism because I feel attacked by the most extreme people that instead of wanting men in the conversation, exclude them. But Emma’s approach to Feminism is bringing guys in to the conversation to learn new lessons and recognize biases They didn’t know they had. Conversation and compromise are the two things that hold democracy together, when neither side is willing to listen or compromise nothing is achieved. When I say compromise I don’t mean Women or Men not achieving full equality. I mean that conversation is not possible without appealing to the other side.

While he was able to turn his pain and suffering into art, quite an achievement, he wasn''t able to heal emotionally. It''s usually easier to deal with such things in abstract, intellectual and artistic ways.

There are patterns of sounds, which means some sounds will cause relaxation, other sounds might bother one same person and many youtubers don''t realize that these cannot be mixed. Me, for an example, hate very high pitched noises, hate plastic and eating sounds. Latte could never have a disturbing plastic noise on her videos. She just knows what''s up.',586);

Observer pattern is a MUST for game dev with larger projects. Having objects that fire events and other objects that subscribe to them is a much more sustainable way to do things than having a million references in each class to other objects, and it makes your code more modular (each class/game object is its own self contained thing). Singleton and Factory patterns, as well as SOLID principles are also good to look into. Factory less so for Unity since you can use GetComponent to retrieve references for things. If you''re using Unity, learn to use Unity events/C# events and you will make your code a lot cleaner and save time on large projects.',26);

Most of that saturation is from people who aren''t very good or who call themselves data scientists because they completed a mooc or two. There''s a huge difference between completing certs and degrees and being able to actually do things in the real world. The wheat gets separated from the chaff pretty quickly.',15);

I also resonated with your prior MIMO video on learning data science particularly on learning just enough and start doing projects. I also leveraged data science to solve biology data problem (that helps to make a positive impact in this video) which at the time was a novel thing. I repeated this cycle for solving various biology data problems and before you know it, topics that I used to get stuck on became less intimidating and started to sink in.

I’ve got an engineering degree and had courses like probability & statistics, linear algebra, integral and differential calculus. I have a letter of acceptance from a community college in Canada for Business and Advanced Analytics in a post grad diploma program with subjects like python, sql, machine learning, etc. I’m studying python and data science online at the moment in preparation for my Winter 2023 intake. Will brush up my knowledge on statistics, linear algebra and calculus by August as this is a requirement by the program. Back in the days, I had the opportunity to represent our school in Math competitions. What surprises me is that I can still study for 5 - 8 straight hours everyday and sometimes forgetting my businesses as I now leave my managers to decide on their own.

As a data scientist, one can only be a generalist until and unless he has domain knowledge of the field his company works in. The fascination with data science dies down once the projects are not relevant to your field of interest/domain of expertise. Moreover, companies now have a hard time justifying the massive amount of investment done towards data science. It''s better to be a domain expert and then add skills of data science rather than just being a generalist data scientist without any domain expertise.

Also more ram doesn’t really mean higher frame rates, but higher quality textures or assets or increase the distance before you see LOD culling.

Go out into the field and unknowingly bring the wrong brand of batteries for your solar panels that you don’t figure out until your back? Oh well.

Sometimes you want to limit your dataset. For example if you''re trying to figure out if you''re in a stock market recession or expansion you don''t want to go over 2 years (+- months) of data because you''ll end up in another cycle. Symmetry and Domain limits are important in machine learning. My point is sometimes too much data is a waste of time and resources',0);

As a data scientist myself, I was a little surprised at how high the job satisfaction scores were.  On the job, a lot of my peers find that they aren''t challenged enough by their positions. This is probably because data science is still relatively new, and companies are still figuring out how to create value with data teams. The other side of that is that once you have a data science role it is pretty easy to land another data science job so qualified data scientists can just leave if they aren''t liking the position at hand.

If you really don’t find a lot of interest in algorithms, data structures, and theory of cs, as viable as it is, this major may most probably not be for you.

If one observes a particle (planet) around the nucleus (sun) with a shutter speed equal to one revolution, it would register at one position only; 1/2 cycle would result in two opposite positions. At higher speeds more positions are collected and the vibration (wave) function starts to reveal itself.

SHA was designed to be fast to compute making it very useful for older hardware and things like signatures, but you typically want the exact opposite for passwords. For a password hashing algorithm, you want it as slow as possible until it starts annoying users. That way, an attacker will be able to calculate fewer hashes per second while brute forcing. As of right now, the usual choices for password hashing are bcrypt or argon2id, both of which were designed to be slow.',45);

That, I have long believed is nonsensical without mention of relative rates of time layering.  I note that Feynman''s QED is not actually sensible, explanatory, or even rational but only exquisitely descriptive.  This vid also illuminated for me, the ubiquitous ‘hairiness’ of the universe as a thick tangle of ER/EPR entanglement ‘filaments’ stretched in at least 4D by an infinitude of time sheared partners.

Some (mostly the younger ones) are ... So curious. At first it''s like "WOW! U THREAT?!" once it establishes that you are not, it''s like "Eeer ... What are you then? I''ve never seen one of you around before." and there begins the act of mutual curiosity :3. You slowly reach with a finger, it sends a tentacle ... you both touch, sometimes they get frightened and clamp your entire hand, flashing black before letting go, but not swimming away. They are playful, find a shiny pebble, hand it to the octopus, it''ll take it, check if it can be eaten ... discard it ... then a few sec after send a tentacle back to the pebble out of curiosity as to "why did he give me this pebble ... gotta check again for anything special".

Specifically the ability of bacterium changing their polarity quickly through chemical absorption of charged ions that are easily available through their outer cell wall causing that microbe to move, in a since, chemically. That would explain the speed of its movement as if turning on and off a light. In effect, just by changing of polarity of a biome would move it through time and space while leaving it''s structure idle, at its point of origin, but alter the quality of a distant biome into the parent''s original quality. In this accomplishing the  quantum speeds. Said energy in itself could then be transferred into movement, pressure fluctuation to force fluid movement or constriction, as well as color change.

We are reaching the limit of being able to discern what is novel with what could be attributed to another already agreed understanding even if the correlation is not obvious. Even our inherent bias may get in the way, and like any puzzle, such as a sadoku, we may eventually learn that the complex mathematics could be on the wrong track and have to be scrapped only to have to start basically from some previous branch no matter how far back, and finally, it seems we are fast running out of feasible experiments to confirm or deny the predictions made by quantum mechanics.',0);

There''s also some really cool tech on their platform where you get a live integrated cloud-based coding environment with all of the source files for each challenge automatically updated as you go through the course so it''s very seamless and the video tutorial part of it is not a video but instead is a scripted live editing of the code in the text editor.

Most of CS is a lot of abstract data structures and ideas that you may never even ever use, but knowing the pipeline of actually creating software and those different methodologies (Agile which is just old school RAD with more crap to have to deal with, Waterfall, Spiral, etc. etc.) will give you a better idea of what you''ll be doing on the day to day.

CS researchers routinely make falsifiable claims about the real world and then test those claims through experiments. In fact, that''s how I''m spending my winter holiday :) Like, "If I solve this problem with method X instead of method Y, I get a more reliable answer." Of course, if you only have empirical evidence (i.e. it''s been tested in the real world) your case is weaker than if you have a mathematical proof. So in that way, it might be that some problems CS folks tackle are "scientific" empirical questions until they can be handled more rigorously with mathematics. But some big, popular branches of CS like Machine Learning and AI advance primarily through empirical, rather than mathematic, evidence. Whether mathematics itself is a science I will leave to the writers of dictionaries :)',18);

Of course, it isn''t neccessary to keep bonsais at such a small size when the trees could become much bigger, but as long as they are kept healthy I don''t see a problem with it.

Thanks from Brazil!',5);

I asked a friend of mine how I could what books I should read etc. first thing he did was stop me in my sentence and say “you don’t need to research all these functions and data structures and take notes from textbooks, you just need to know what is possible” and that really reasonated  with me because once you know what is possible, you can think of a problem and as the video states “learn by doing”, my friend said to work I’m projects I want to solve or replicate and implement what I have learned that way. Rather than sitting around reading these books.',33);

I think that’s where a lot of the burnout comes from. I work in DevOps and teach full stack so going to school for machine learning sounds like a large leap. Learning how to build better ML pipelines are much more worth my time.',0);

A playful approach can also speed things up depending on how you learn and of course patience. For those interested in R and python, the latest R studio IDE is great and allows you to run both side by side with reticulate. It can seem a steep curve but those with a grounding in R and statistics you can run ML scripts side by side and learn the similarities and where they differ.',0);
